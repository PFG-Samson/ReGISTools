ReGIS
A GIS Enterprise Asset & Records System — Blueprint & Stakeholder Pitch
________________________________________
Executive summary (Pitch for stakeholders)
A secure, government-grade GIS-driven Enterprise Asset & Records System that combines a modern spatial data backbone with integrated staff and document management. The platform centralizes location-aware records (assets, staff, files), improves operational visibility, reduces duplication and audit risk, and enables faster, evidence-based decisions at scale — from municipal planning to agency-level asset stewardship.
Key benefits for stakeholders
•	Single source of truth for all assets, staff, and records tied to place.
•	Faster decisions using map-based search, filters and dashboards.
•	Reduced audit and compliance risk through immutable logs and retention policies.
•	Operational savings from optimized maintenance, reduced duplicate procurement, and better resource distribution.
•	Easy integration with existing ERP/HR systems and government services.

One-line value proposition
"Turn complex asset, staff and records management into a searchable, auditable, location-smart system that saves money, reduces risk and speeds operations."

Typical user flows (concise)
1) Asset registration (office flow)
1.	Asset Manager selects “New Asset.”
2.	Fill form: type, serial no., custodian, purchase_date, value, warranty, status.
3.	Drop or draw geometry on map (point/line/polygon) or enter coordinates.
4.	Attach documents (invoice, warranty), set retention rules and tags.
5.	Save → triggers audit entry and optional approval workflow if value exceeds threshold.
2) Field update & inspection (mobile)
1.	Technician scans QR on asset (or searches by asset ID).
2.	Opens inspection checklist; records condition score, notes, geo-tagged location.
3.	Uploads photo or file (optional) and marks maintenance required.
4.	Field entry syncs to server (offline queue if no connectivity). A work order is created if needed.
3) File linkage & retrieval
1.	Records Manager uploads contract with metadata (contract_no, parties, start/end date).
2.	Links contract to asset(s) and department(s).
3.	Any user (with permission) searches by asset → sees linked documents and audit history.
4) Approval workflow (procurement)
1.	Department Manager initiates request to buy new asset from UI.
2.	Workflow routes to Budget Owner → Procurement → Approver.
3.	Upon approval, Asset Manager records procurement and assigns asset ID; system updates inventory and depreciation schedule.

Data model snapshot (simplified)
•	assets: id, name, category, serial_no, geom, status, condition_score, custodian_id, purchase_date, value, metadata_json
•	staff: id, name, role, office_geom, contact, certifications, manager_id
•	documents: id, title, type, linked_entity (asset/staff/department), uploaded_by, upload_date, retention_policy
•	work_orders: id, asset_id, created_by, assigned_to, status, priority, scheduled_date, closed_date, cost
•	audit_logs: id, entity_type, entity_id, action, user_id, timestamp, change_summary

Architecture overview (recommendation)
•	Frontend: React + Leaflet/OpenLayers (single-page app)
•	API: FastAPI / Django REST / Node.js (REST + GraphQL optional)
•	Database: PostgreSQL + PostGIS
•	File storage: S3-compatible (or on-prem object store) with encryption
•	Authentication: SSO (SAML/OIDC) + optional 2FA
•	Caching / Tiles: Vector tiles (TileServer GL or similar) and CDN for performance
•	Mobile: React Native or PWA with offline sync and local DB (SQLite/PouchDB)
•	Deployment: Cloud or on-prem hybrid for sensitive data; use container orchestration (k8s) for scale

MVP (12-week suggested scope)
Deliverables:
1.	Asset registry (CRUD) with spatial geometry and PostGIS backend.
2.	Staff directory with location linking.
3.	Document upload + linking to asset/staff.
4.	Map view with layer toggles and spatial query (buffer/nearest).
5.	Basic RBAC and audit log.
6.	REST API for core entities and simple export (CSV/GeoJSON).
7.	Lightweight mobile PWA for asset lookup and simple inspection (read/write, offline queue).
Success metrics for MVP:
•	80% of target asset fields captured in the system.
•	Mobile lookup latency < 2s on typical 4G.
•	User acceptance by pilot department (≥1 department onboarded).

Implementation considerations & risks
•	Data governance: Define owners, retention, and classification up front.
•	Data migration: Bulk import tools and deduplication rules for legacy spreadsheets.
•	Security: Design RBAC and row-level security early to avoid costly rework.
•	Offline sync issues: Conflict resolution strategy and merge rules required.
•	Change management: Training, documentation and pilot phase essential for adoption.

Estimated benefits & ROI drivers (qualitative)
•	Lower duplicate procurement and asset loss through centralized registry.
•	Faster response and maintenance turnaround by enabling field-to-office workflows.
•	Reduced compliance fines and legal exposure via auditable document retention.
•	Better budgeting accuracy (depreciation + lifecycle) improving capital planning.
